# MAKE A CANDY MACHINE THAT REWARDS FOR SOLVING MATH

## Introduction to Today's Workshop

You may have seen kids looking at the candy machines all around the place and hoping to get one. Now you can have one in your home, that they can access â€“ only if they solve some simple Maths problems.

## Layout of the workshop
To make things easier for you we have segmented the workshop into different parts: <br/>

**Part 1 - LCD**
- By following the circuit diagram in "Part 1 - LCD" directory, make the circuit shown.
- Next, install the library associated with this part. <br/>

- Try either one of the examples to see if your connections are fine and your system is working.

**Part 2 - Keypad**
- By following the circuit diagram in "Part 2 - Keypad" directory, make the circuit shown.
- Next, install the library associated with this part. <br/>

- Try the first example to see if your connections are fine and your system is working.
- Next, run the second example to see how the keypad works in conjunction with the LCD screen.

**Part 3 - Servo**
- By following the circuit diagram in "Part 3 - Servo" directory, make the circuit shown.
- Next, install the library associated with this part. <br/>

- First, try the example with the LCD, called **"servo_LCD-Example_1.ino"** 
- Then, try the other example.

**Part 4 - Candy Dispensor**
- As you can see, the circuit in the diagram is completed as you followed the previous steps of connecting the assorted components. 
- Run the code in the directory "Part 4 - Candy Dispensor"
- to see how the approach we took to do the calculation for random problems, see the **"calculation.ino"** file.
