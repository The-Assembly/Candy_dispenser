# LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)

## LiquidCrystal Library

This library allows an Arduino board to control LiquidCrystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset, which is found on most text-based LCDs. The library works with in either 4- or 8-bit mode (i.e. using 4 or 8 data lines in addition to the rs, enable, and, optionally, the rw control lines).

## Pinout

**RS (Register shift)**: This pin is used to select whether data or an instruction is being transferred between the microcontroller and the LCD. <br/>
**R/W (Read/Write)**: It determines the data direction. <br/>
**E (Enable)**: The E Clock is used to initiate the data transfer within the LCD. <br/>

## Description of the module
The HD44780- based LCD unit can be operated in two modes, 8-bit and 4-bit mode. In 4-bit mode data is send using two four bit nibbles (First high four bits and then low four bits with an E Clock pulse with each nibble). The correct timing of the control signals is generated by software; therefore any AVR with at least seven free I/O pins can be used.Apart from the data-bus, 2 or 3 control-lines are needed, namely RS (Register shift), R/W (Read/Write) and E (Enable).

## 4-bit display vs 8-bit
●	4-bit mode uses 4 I/O port pins for data and two or three additional I/O pins for control.
●	8-bit mode uses 8 I/O port pins for data and two or three additional I/O pins for control.
●	4-bit mode requires two 4-bit transfers for each instruction and character that is sent to the display.
●	8-bit mode requires only one 8-bit transfer for each instruction and character that is sent to the display.
●	The implication is that, 4-bit data transfers will take twice as much time to transfer as 8-bit data transfers.
●	4-bit data transfers use 4 I/O lines less then 8-bit data fransfers.
●	It is a trade off! You save up to 4 I/O lines using 4-bit mode over that of 8-bit mode but, the data transfer takes twice as long in 4-bit mode as it does in 8-bit mode.
●	If I/O is limited, 4-bit mode might be the way to go. If I/O is plentiful, but time is important, 8-bit mode may be the way to go.
●	4-bit data transfers also require a bit more code as, the lower nibble will need to be shifted into the upper nibble with each command and character transfer.

# Potentiometer

●	A potentiometer simply is a variable resistor! As resistors, its value is expressed in Ohms. Usually, potentiometers have a value between 1k and 10M. If you turn the potentiometer, its value will change. It has 3 lugs, named A, B and C (or 1, 2 and 3, respectively) .
●	Inside the potentiometer, there is a resistive track. When you rotate the potentiometer, the length of this resistive track varies between the lugs, and you vary the value of the resistance.
●	So when you rotate the potentiometer to the right, the resistance between A and B increases. When you rotate it to the left, it diminishes.
Inversely, if you rotate it to the right, the resistance between B and C is reduced, and to the right it increases.
